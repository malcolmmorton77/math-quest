# Math tester

## Malcolm M.

One of my friends has learned the major capitals of all the countries in the world.
I am not so keen on learning all of those, but I do love math.
Here is a small tool to study your times tables and get a few quick random math questions.

## prompt.cpp

- Has a small menu and some functions to help
- interactive with the user

## prompt.h

- definitions and macros and includes

### To run

- `make` will build the program, clear the terminal and begin executing it
