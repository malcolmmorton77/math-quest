# Math Quest

## Malcolm M.

One of my friends learned all of the major capitals of all the countries in the world.
I am not so keen on learning all of those, but I do love math.
Here is a small tool to study your times tables and get a few quick random math questions.

_Feature List_

- Menu to choose options or quit
- Option to view the times tables (with correct rows and columns)
- Grabs user input safely and prompts when user enters non-number
- Prints 5 questions for user to answer and exits once answered

## prompt.cpp

- Has a small menu and some functions to help
- interactive part of the code for the user

## prompt.h

- definitions, macros, and includes

### To run

- `make` will build the program, clear the terminal and begin executing it
